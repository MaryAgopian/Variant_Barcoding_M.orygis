# Detecting Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms in Mycobacterium orygis for the Creation of Standardized Diagnostic Markers

## Variant Barcoding of *Mycobacterium orygis*
### What is *Mycobacterium orygis*
*Mycobacterium orygis* is an overlooked member of the *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* complex (MTBC). *M. orygis* had initially been detected in animals such as oryxes, cattle, antelopes, and rhesus monkeys. However, *M. orygis* has recently been isolated in patients presenting with tuberculosis from South Asia (Bangladesh, India, Nepal, and Pakistan). *M. orygis* has no accepted markers for identifying and tracking, which is a point of concern for rapid clinical diagnosis and epidemiological tracking. 
### What is variant barcoding?
Variant barcoding is an *in silico* technique that uses nucleotide markers, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), to distinguish variants.
### Our hypothesis
We hypothesize that by using the variant barcoding methodology and validating our findings through Polymerase Chain Reaction and Sanger Sequencing, we would identify *M. orygis* specific SNPs that can be used as standard markers for *M. orygis* detection.

Pipeline for Variant Barcoding of *Mycobacterium orygis*

Pipeline detailing the various steps involved in quality checking, data clean-up, SNP generation and visualization, and phylogenetic tree generation and visualization. This pipeline has been modified and adapted to suit this project from the BAGEP pipeline [BAGEP GitHub](https://github.com/idolawoye/BAGEP).
