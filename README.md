# Variant Barcoding of *Mycobacterium orygis*

## *Mycobacterium orygis* is an overlooked pathogen with no standard markers for its identification
Performing this variant analysis will allow us to identify potential standardised markers with the **goal of *M. orygis* identification in clinical and epidemiological settings.**
> We aim to accomplish this through the **identification of SNP based markers specific in *M. orygis* genomes in comparison to *M. africanum*, *M. bovis* and *M. tuberculosis*.**

## Pipeline
> The variant barcoding pipelines published and initially cited in the published literature have software that have either depreciated, have unresolved bugs, or do not work in the Mac Operating System (OSX).
> 
**This repository has a 2021-updated version of this pipeline using softwares and their counterparts that are compatible with OSX and are still maintained.**
