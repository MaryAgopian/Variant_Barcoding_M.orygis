# Variant Barcoding of *Mycobacterium orygis*

## *Mycobacterium orygis* is an emerging pathogen with no main markers for its identification
Performing this variant analysis will allow us to produce markers with the **goal of its identification in clinical and epidemiological settings.**
> We aim to accomplish this through the **identification of SNP based markers specific in *M. orygis* genomes in comparison to *M. bovis*, *M. tuberculosis* and *M. africanum*.**
> 
We hypothesize that the detected markers using the outlined barcoding methodology are sufficient markers to differentiate *M. orygis* from other members of the MTBC.

## Pipeline
> The variant barcoding pipelines published and initially cited in the published literature have software that have either depreciated, have unresolved bugs, or do not work in the Mac Operating System (OSX).
> 
**This repository has a 2021-updated version of this pipeline using softwares and their counterparts that are compatible with OSX and are still maintained.**
